**Do it Differently.<br>Fly on Your Own Wings.<br>Rave Voyeurism is Not a Crime**

Since the release of his 2012 album, _Quantum Jelly_, Lorenzo Senni has been developing a unique – and increasingly personal – take on the euphoric tropes of classic trance. His approach has culminated in two releases on the legendary Warp label: 2016’s widely-acclaimed _Persona_, and ‘The Shape of Trance to Come’, one of Mixmag’s Top 10 Tracks of 2017.

Forget the big drums and the bigger drops — Senni’s music is a postmodern fugue, an assemblage of divine melodies wrapped propulsively around and through each other. Tight repetitions of clustered notes rise into neon clouds of widescreen musical bliss, by turns exhilarating and melancholy, sugar-coated and sublime. It’s not nostalgic, and it’s not ironic; it’s a genuine push for connection, a casting off of inhibitions, a call-to-arms for lovers and dancers both.

Senni grew up playing guitar and drums in hardcore punk bands, but eventually turned his talents to the Roland JP8000 synthesiser and the glistening arpeggios of trace. It’s here, in this often saccharine, often disregarded sound, that Senni has refined his singular voice, pioneering a totally fresh way of hearing some of the most familiar sounds in dance music history.

While his earliest experiments with trance were somewhat clinical, rigid even, _Persona_ marked the emergence of a looser, wilder, more intuitive aspect in Senni’s work. The sound of _Persona_, developed even further in ‘The Shape of Trance to Come’, is gloriously multifaceted - surging forward with luminous patterns before folding back in on itself, exposing a more vulnerable,emotional side.

It’s music which wants to incorporate all the many emotions of the club within itself, bouncing from one to the other in a joyful, laser-splattered blitz.
