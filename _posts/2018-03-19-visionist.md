Visionist is the London-based experimental composer and producer Louis Carnell. His first official releases appeared in 2011 via labels 92 Points and Left Blank. His distinctive take on the post-grime sound would lead to appearances on compilations such as Big Dada’s Grime 2.0 and Keysound Recording’s Allstars series. 2013 saw a trio of releases - 'Snakes' on Leisure System, 'M / Secrets' for Ramp Recordings, and a breakthrough EP, <i>I'm Fine</i>, for Lit City Trax. It was this record which began to define and inform the sound of Visionist releases to follow.

Picking up where <i>I’m Fine</i> left off, in 2015 Visionist released his debut album <i>Safe</i> via the lauded experimental powerhouse, PAN Records. Described as ‘a personal portrait of anxiety,’ <i>Safe</i> dealt head on with issues of mental health at a time when the music industry was only just beginning to open up to the discussion. It was described by Pitchfork as ‘a statement that feels not just a flexing of experimental techniques, but something rich and human, too.’ Further critical praise for Visionist has come from the likes of Resident Advisor, Crack, SPIN, The Guardian, and Rolling Stone, who cited him as an 'artist to watch’ in 2016.

In 2012, Visionist founded his own label Lost Codes, going on to release some of the first music from artists such as SD Laika and Dark0. He later went on to form the label Codes with PAN, releasing new music from Sky H1, Kamixlo, Ling and Acre / Filter Dread.

In 2017 Visionist returned with a new album <i>Value</i>. Released via Big Dada, it explores complex interweaving ideas of artistic value and self-worth, while building on the distinct sound of previous releases. The project also features creative collaborations with influential Belgian artist Peter De Potter on the album artwork and zine, and Daniel Sannwald on the artist shots, with Frederik Heyman and Teri Varhol directing forthcoming visuals.

Visionist will be accompanied at the Chocolate Factory by Pedro Maia, a Portuguese filmmaker and audio-visual artist known for his specific interest in working with analog film. His new work for Visionist is one of chaos and absurdity; original, disturbing and surreally beautiful.

**Critical Acclaim for <i>Value</i>:**

“The London producer’s latest full-length, a high-concept electronic consideration of the artistic soul, balances between fragility and bombast” — Pitchfork

“We’re left blinking into neon lights post-anxiety attack, with our pupils hastily trying to readjust and our pulses still racing…if Safe was Visionists ‘personal portrait of anxiety’ then Value is his awakening.” — Mixmag (9/10)

“A bold, ambitious album that once again finds Visionist truly worthy of his forward-thinking moniker.” — PopMatters

“Carnell deals in beatless, breathless abstractions, all high concepts well buried in dense atmospherics and sonic pyrotechnics.” — Clash

“Value could be the most important electronic album released this year.” Gigwise (9/10)

“An emotionally charged vocal piece which suggests that Carnell himself is a character every bit as complex as the sonic environments he creates.” — Q
